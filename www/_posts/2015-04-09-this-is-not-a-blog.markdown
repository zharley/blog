In attempting to choose a backend for this site, I experienced a kind of mental paralysis induced by too many options called [The Paradox of Choice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice) after a famous book by that title. The phenomenon is also called [overchoice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overchoice), a great word coined in [Future Shock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Shock), another book I should read.

I considered using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/), [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) and many of the [1200+ alternatives](http://www.cmsmatrix.org/), trying to find something light, flexible and efficient. After considerable effort, I had narrowed it down to a handful of minimalist CMS projects (e.g. [Textpattern](http://textpattern.com/), [Pico](http://picocms.org/), [Monstra](http://monstra.org/)), when I stumbled on a new idea: **go static**.

At the bottom of [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) I noticed the text: "Using Jekyll, you can blog using beautiful Markdown syntax, and without having to deal with any databases." Um, yes please. As it turns out, [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is considered a *static site generator*, rather than a CMS, because the latter implies dynamic page generation on the server side (although I'm not entirely convinced of the distinction).

With Jekyll, despite the existence of [dozens of alternatives](https://staticsitegenerators.net/), the burden of overchoice is relieved by the fact that the switching cost is extremely low. You can feed it simple [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), which is very portable. Meanwhile, Jekyll is the definition of minimal, weighing a slender 3,363 lines of code (as counted by my [sloccount](http://www.dwheeler.com/sloccount/)).

So, this site, which is clearly *not a blog*, is going to be Jekyll-powered and stored on [Github](https://github.com/zharley/blog).
